## 🧪 Usage  

1. **Add a New Screen**:  
   Add a new file in the `app/` folder, such as `profile.js`, and define your component.  

   ```javascript  
   import { View, Text } from 'react-native';  

   export default function ProfileScreen() {  
       return (  
           <View>  
               <Text>Welcome to the Profile Screen!</Text>  
           </View>  
       );  
   }  
   ```  

   Now you can navigate to `/profile` in your app!  

2. **Use Pre-designed Components**:  
   Import and use components directly from the `components/` folder.  

   ```javascript  
   import Button from '../components/Button';  

   <Button title="Click Me" onPress={() => alert('Button Pressed!')} />  
   ```

## 🌟 Getting Started with Expo Router  

- Routes are auto-generated based on the `app/` folder.  
- Define a new screen by simply adding a `.js` file in the folder.  
- Dynamic routing is supported—e.g., `app/[id].js` maps to `/123`.
